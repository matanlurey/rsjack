# rsjack

A Rust implementation of Black Jack.

The goal of this project is to learn a bit more about TUI programming in Rust
(without heavy use of existing libraries). By the end of the implementation
it should be possible to:

1. Start, play, and end a game of Black Jack against an automated Dealer.

... and that's it!
